# PQRS-People Queue Registration System
PQRS-People Queue Registration System is a mini-project designed using JavaScript that has been designed for shop owners for managing crowd in the shops they own. Its main aim is to make a queue of customer details as the customers enter the shop. On click of add/delete button, the customer details can be added or removed from the queue respectively. The admin of the registered shop has the options to sort the details of the customers on the basis of their entry time, or the number of items they approximately require for shopping, or on the basis of their name/A unique ID that will be assigned to them as they enter the shop. On clicking display the admin will be able to see the customer details and also, once the queue becomes full, a timer of 10 minutes will be set and will begin to countdown to notify the admin as to how long the shopkeepers are in the shop and an alert message will be given as soon as the timer ends. Once the queue becomes empty, the timer will automatically reset, which implies that the next batch of customers are ready to enter the shop.
